Introduction
-------------------------------
In the modern world of corporate employment, people are working harder and longer hours than ever, so much so that it can often be difficult to manage that precious one hour lunch break properly. This app was developed with these nearly universal issues in mind. Hour Long Lunch is meant to serve the needs of users looking for nearby food trucks, and some standalone venues, with accurate walking directions, price data, and daily updated map data, all in the name of simplified time management.
For a full description of the app, visit the About App link on the page:

Requirements
-------------------------------
This app requires a stable internet connection, and the ability to interact with the Google Maps API.
The app is optimized for use on mobile devices, as well as on laptop computers.

Installation
-------------------------------
Ideally, in the future, this app could be deployed to the app store and would be easily installed on mobile devices.

Configuration
-------------------------------
To configure the application properly, toggle on the appropriate daily layer of the map, and simply click to interact with the populated map points.

Troubleshooting and FAQ
-------------------------------
If the truck locations do not display, insure that the proper layers are toggled on in the map on the page.
