      <div class="twelve columns about-info">
        <p> Hour Long Lunch emerged as an idea to find lunch around Code Fellows when we only have an hour to eat. Within that hour for lunch, part of that time is spent walking, part is spent waiting in line, and much less time to actually eat. Hour Long Lunch maps food truck locations around South Lake Union for every day of the week.

      <div class="twelve columns about-info">
        <p>Choose a location from the interactive map, and you'll see a tidy box pop up that includes the name of the eatery, a link to its website, and the Google directions icon, which will return a result that includes your walk time to that location.
        </p>
      </div><!-- end six columns-->

      <div class="twelve columns about-info">
        <p>The map has an additional feature called "Two Martini Lunch" that shows sit down restaurants within the same area for days when users have more time. Two Martini Lunch has it's own page with a simple text based list of places that would be easier to scroll through if directions and travel time aren't necessarily a consideration.
        </p>
      </div><!-- about info -->

      <div class="twelve columns about-info">
        <p>Some locations will also have some additional information based on user submitted input, such as an average wait time for that location so that you can estimate your total time to walk to the location and order and receive your food, so that you'll know how much time you'll have left to eat. Users can also submit a rating and food type.
        </p>
      </div><!-- end six columns -->

      <div class ="twelve columns about-info">
        <p>Over time, this app could be extended so that even more user input data could be added, such as price range and reviews. Ideally, we would improve it so that the user input submits directly to the map itself, so that no manual updates are required.
        </p>
      </div><!-- end four columns-->

      <div class="twelve columns about-info">
        <p>The app was designed to be optimized for mobile, as most users would likely be using it on their phone, with use as a web app as a secondary consideration. The app design has intentionally been kept very simple and streamlined with this functionality in mind.
        </p>
      </div><!-- end four columns -->

      <div class="twelve columns about-info">
        <p>Ideally, this app could eventually be deployed as an actual downloadable app.
